## Poster Components

It is recommended, but optional, that you follow the standard narrative structure used by most academic posters.

For example:

* Abstract
* Background/Introduction
* Research Questions
* Methodologies
* Results
* Conclusions/Insights.

However, this is just an optional recommendation, feel free to deviate from this structure if you feel you can present the work in a better way.

The following guide, from NYU Libraries, is a good resource on what makes a good research poster: [https://guides.nyu.edu/posters](https://guides.nyu.edu/posters)
